        <h1>COLUMN</h1>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.
        These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. 
        They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.
        Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.Pollution is the introduction of substances or energy 
        (such as light or heat) into the natural environment in amounts or concentrations that can be harmful for humans, animals, and plants.
        Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. 
        Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.
        All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of air and water. 
        When these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.
        Pollution is a global problem.
